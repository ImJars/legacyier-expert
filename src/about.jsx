                        Hello! My name is √Ångel and I like technology, I enjoy 
                        creating web applications and developing software. I started 
                        programming in 2014 during high school, in 2017 I started with 
                        web development during professional projects at university, 
                        I liked it so much that I continue to implement new technologies 
                        in my developments.

                        I continue my path in development learning new technologies and I had 
                        the privilege of working with some giant Mexican companies and some web 
                        development agencies, where I have learned the best.

                        I'm thinking of launching a web development course for beginners because I like to 
                        teach, although it will be in the near future.
